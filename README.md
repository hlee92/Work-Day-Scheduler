# Work-Day-Scheduler

The goal of this challenge/project was to create a simple work day scheduler.

1. The point of this assigment was to create an hour by hour work scheduler.

2. When the user enters a task, hits save, and refreshes the page, the task will still show up on the scheduler. 

3. There are red and green blocks that indicate present, past, and future tasks.
